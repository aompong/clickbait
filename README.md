# YouTube Clickbait Project
CS121 Spring 2019

The predict.py script shows an example of how the clickbait detection is done:

usage: predict.py [-h] --title TITLE [--views VIEWS] [--likes LIKES]
                  [--dislikes DISLIKES] [--comments COMMENTS] [--imagepath IMAGEPATH]
                  
Provide the script with the title of the video to analyze and, if known, the number of views, likes, dislikes, comments and thumbnail image path. The script will print the model prediction: 1 if the video is probably clickbait, 0 otherwise.
